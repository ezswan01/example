In this essay I will critically consider the ways in which Queen Elizabeth I asserted a powerful identity as a female monarch. I will overview the different ways in which she justified and self-legitimised her reign despite her gender and how she used gender stereotypes and expectations to her advantage. I will analyse different texts written by her, such as her poetry and speeches. Additionally, I will analyse some paintings of her. Finally, I will conclude my essay.

Queen Elizabeth I's poem “On Monsieur’s Departure” depicts her struggle between her personal feelings and her responsibilities as a monarch. The opening line “I grieve and dare not show my discontent” (Queen Elizabeth I, line 1) illustrates this struggle as she is forced to hide her emotions lest she appear weak as a monarch. The poem reflects her inner turmoil and the balance she must find between her identity as the Queen and how she must represent herself to the outside world, and her inner self. This balance is especially acute because of her gender. She must navigate her society's gendered expectations of women and still maintain a powerful image as the ruling monarch. The poem is filled with contradictions in her state of mind. She states “I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate./ I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,/ Since from myself another self I turned” (Queen Elizabeth I, lines 4-6) depicting the dichotomy her character is forced into by her circumstances. 

Elizabeth I’s poem “The doubt of future foes” addresses the many threats posed against the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, such as Mary Queen of Scots. Elizabeth addresses both what she deems internal threats: “For falsehood now doth flow, and subjects’ faith doth ebb” (Queen Elizabeth I, line 4) and external threats: “No foreign banished wight shall anchor in this port” (Queen Elizabeth I, line 13). Elizabeth addresses these threats in different manners. For her subjects she seems almost chideful “Which should not be, if reason ruled or wisdom weaved the web.” (Queen Elizabeth I). Her response asserts herself as the wise ruler and her implied threat is mostly intellectual. At the end of the poem she asserts herself in a more forceful manner “My rusty sword through rest shall first his edge employ/ To poll their tops who seek such change or gape for future joy.” (Queen Elizabeth I, lines 15-16) showing that she is not afraid to be ruthless and employ violence to ensure her reign and the stability of the monarchy. That her sword is rusty also implies that thus far she has been peaceful, but that she is willing to diverge from more diplomatic approaches if she considers it due. The poem ends with a succinct yet powerful statement “Vivat Regina” (Queen Elizabeth I, line 17) which is Latin for ‘long live the queen’.

The balancing of gender stereotypes that Queen Elizabeth I utilises to assert herself is especially evident in her public speeches. Rose (1077) writes that “In her public speeches Elizabeth justifies her political decisions (and nondecisions), repeatedly seeking to establish the terms of her legitimacy as the reigning monarch. It is in these speeches, therefore, that she cogently formulates and defines her authority, and she does so in explicitly gendered terms”.
Elizabeth I addresses her army in “Speech to the Troops at Tilbury” who are about to face the Spanish armada. She begins her speech by stating “My loving people, I have been persuaded by some that are careful of my safety, to take heed how I committed myself to armed multitudes, for fear of treachery. But I tell you that I would not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people.” Queen Elizabeth I, 407). Elizabeth’s advisers tried to protect her but she chooses to disregard their advice showing her agency. She also shows love for her people.

“Scholars have argued that in the contested capacity of female ruler, the queen functions politically by disarmingly acknowledging her femininity and then erasing it through appropriating the prestige of male kingship” (Rose, 1079). This can be seen in the quote: “I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and a king of England too” (Queen Elizabeth I, 407). The female monarch has to work with people’s beliefs about women, but she justifies her power by claiming masculine qualities like the heart and stomach of a king. This is reflected in Greene’s article: “In this oration, she probably mentioned being a woman to disarm any chauvinistic anxieties aroused by her unusual appearance on a battlefield by meeting those fears directly, tactfully allowing her subjects to entertain them even as she gracefully disproved their necessity.” (Green, 427)
Elizabeth being amongst the troops to deliver her speech also goes against what would have been typical of any other woman at the time. Elizabeth utilises the image of a male hero in the quote “-- being resolved in the midst of the battle to live and die amongst you all” (Queen Elizabeth I, 407). 
She is very possessive of her people and country: “- and take foul scorn that Parma or any other prince of Europe should dare to invade the borders of my realm.” (Queen Elizabeth I, 407). Elizabeth does not sit idly by: “--I myself will venter my royal blood; I myself will be your general, judge, and rewarder of your virtue in the field.” (Queen Elizabeth I, 407).  Her mention of royal blood also further legitimises her role as the monarch even though she is a woman. Elizabeth uses a lot of possessive language in the speech:“Enemies of my God and my kingdom” and “the borders of my realm” and “My loving people”. (Queen Elizabeth I, 407). This language illustrates how Elizabeth actively asserts her ownership of religion, England, its borders, and its people during a time when religious leadership was exclusively male, as was the legal right to own property. Furthermore, at that time it was not socially acceptable for women to be assertive. 
In the “The Golden Speech” Queen Elizabeth I asserts herself as a monarch by claiming that God has decreed it so, utilising the concept of divine right of kings: “This makes me that I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a queen, as to be a queen over so thankful a people.” (Queen Elizabeth I, 408). As Green notes: “--Elizabeth was her own authority. She does not refer very often to any source inferior to herself and the Almighty” (Green, 424). Later on in the speech Elizabeth states “--I trust, by the almighty power of God, that I shall be His instrument to preserve you from envy, peril, dishonor, shame, tyranny, and oppression--” (Queen Elizabeth I, 409). Here she asserts herself as a protector and defender of the nation. This protectiveness can be interpreted as if she were the mother of the nation: “First, it is widely contended that Elizabeth identifies herself strongly and frequently with the traditionally female roles of virgin and mother” (Rose, 1077). The concept of virgin queen has been discussed in depth by scholars such as King, who suggests that despite limiting herself to a life of virginity, Elizabeth’s relationship with England can be considered to be like that of a husband and wife with England playing the role of the husband. This notion, however, does not encompass the fact that Elizabeth was the head of the household in this relationship and that she does not fulfil the traditional role of an obedient and subservient wife. Rather, she subverts traditional gender roles in assuming the position of head of family, i.e. head of state. 

In The Ermine Portrait Elizabeth is depicted in a large heavily ornamented dress that covers most of her body except for her head and hands. Her presence takes up most of the space in the painting with only a few small details added in. Next to her arm there is a sword laying on a table, and a small white furry animal with a crown around its neck grasping her arm and an olive branch grasped in her other hand. Elizabeth’s hand is very near the sword but not quite touching it. Elizabeth’s posture and stance is wide and her arms are positioned in a similar manner to portraits of gentlemen in the same time period. Elizabeth balances the gender stereotypes and expectations to legitimise her rule as a female monarch, yet she is careful not to appear too masculine. The typical portrait of a gentleman usually depicted him grasping a sword at the hilt. The sword in Elizabeth’s portrait symbolises not only her masculine side, but also her status as the monarch and commander of her armies. Her not grasping the sword could be seen as Elizabeth claiming the masculine and forceful symbolism of the sword but remaining distant enough, as to not appear too unfeminine, and also as her reminding everyone that she is able to command armies at her will if she has to, but remains nonviolent in times of peace. There is a balance between threat and diplomacy. The ermine serves a symbol for status and royalty as the fur on the animal was often used in the robes of royalty. The crown around its neck further solidifies this. The portrait is dark in its colours with the only light coming in from a window in the background that is partially cut off.     
In The Coronation Portrait of Elizabeth I, Queen Elizabeth I is holding an orb and a sceptre. She is crowned and wearing a cloth of gold around her. All of these items symbolise her power and authority. “It is noteworthy that Elizabeth's long hair flows down onto her shoulders in the style of an intact virgin.” (King, 43). This is also reflected in the fact that future paintings of Queen Elizabeth I, stop ageing and remain youthful even in the years close to her death. Unlike most of Queen Elizabeth I portraits, the Coronation Portrait differs from the typical ¾ angle that most portraits of Elizabeth I exhibit. Rather, she is facing straight ahead.  The Armada Portrait shows Elizabeth resting her hand on a globe symbolising British imperialism and conquest. Her hand is resting over the America’s which indicates England's wish to colonise them. As the defeat of the Spanish armada is depicted in the two paintings in the background, the symbolism of conquest and British victory and rule is emphasised. Elizabeth is positioned in front of the chaos of the paintings in the background, with a serene and calm look on her face. She symbolises the peace and prosperity she brings to her nation. 

To summarise, Elizabeth’s poetry both reflects her inner turmoil as a young female monarch and serves as a tool to construct a powerful image to both her subjects and her enemies. In her speeches, Elizabeth utilises different rhetoric tools and gender norms and stereotypes to address her gender yet surpasses the limitations of it. The different tactics used in her speeches legitimise her reign as a female monarch by both addressing her female gender, and adopting masculine traits to justify her rule. In different portraits of Elizabeth I, she is depicted as unaging to further her virgin image. She is depicted in heavily ornamented garb with symbols of power and royalty accompanying her image, such as crowns, sceptres and orbs. To conclude, Elizabeth I uses a variety of tactics to self-legitimise her rule as a female monarch during a time when women were generally not allowed to occupy positions of power.
